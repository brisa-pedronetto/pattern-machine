# 👋 Welcome to the Pattern Machine 👋

This is a silly experiment to create nice patterns out of simple characters. Live version at https://pattern-machine.surge.sh. Enjoy!

## Features:

- Generate patterns from simple characters
- Adaptable patterns, according to screen size
- Change the parameters easily from the Option menu (Google Fonts,
  font size, letter spacing, line height, pattern rotation, background
  and text colors, the characters that form the pattern)
- Shazam button (and click on pattern) generate a new random pattern
- Pre-defined character Packs help setting up the mood
- Spicy the pattern up by rotating some of the characters 🌶
- Satisfaction mode makes everything nicer
- Colorize mode throws some transient color at it, so nice
- History page shows the last generated patterns
- Each new pattern generates a new, unique, URL, copiable from the
  address bar (https://pattern-machine.surge.sh) and shareable as is
- Hide the contros menu with the Pointing Hand button

## Future, possibly:

- Save favourite patterns
- Create shareable profile with saved patterns
- Directory containing everyone's favorites patterns
- Download pattern as desktop/mobile wallpaper or just to use on a project
- Got ideas? Let's talk! https://github.com/brisa-pedronetto/pattern-machine
